1743116909-2,G***e,5.9,"Overall, my stay at this hotel was quite disappointing. The biggest issue was cleanliness. At first glance, the room appeared decent, but that changed when I noticed yellowish-brown stains and strands of hair (from who knows whom) on the bedsheet. In the bathroom, I found an abandoned beer bottle‚Äîlikely left by the previous guest. It didn‚Äôt stop there. In the shower area, I discovered several torn shampoo sachets left on the shelves where toiletries are usually placed. Given these issues, I had solid reasons for rating the cleanliness poorly.

Beyond cleanliness, the room itself was in bad shape. Some lights weren‚Äôt working, parts of the wallpaper were peeling, and the bathroom door lock was broken.

As for the hotel facilities, I didn‚Äôt opt for the breakfast package, but I did check out the breakfast area. The place had a strong cockroach-like smell, and I was relieved I hadn‚Äôt booked the package. The swimming pool looked decent, though I didn‚Äôt get the chance to try it. However, when I explored the first floor, I found the lighting was extremely poor‚Äîso bad that they hadn‚Äôt even bothered turning on the lights, making the area feel eerie and uninviting.

The WiFi was also disappointing, with a speed of only around 5 Mbps. I had to rely on my mobile data instead. The one saving grace was that the air conditioning worked fine.

Unfortunately, given all these issues, I won‚Äôt be staying here again.",2025-02-23,7

The bed was small for executive suite. The room is old and less maintenance. Lights in the room were so poor and mosquitoes came inside the room that's annoying. The bathroom was dirty. I got dirty towel and wet bath mat. The towel so stinky smell like cockroach. Shower head didn't work. The floor in the bathtub area was broken and dirty. I booked for 2 nights in the executive suite, but I would like to say, this hotel has really bad executive suite. All the pictures in app were old, current hotel condition is so bad. My booking was including breakfast. However, I didn't take the breakfast because when I walked passing by the kitchen its door was open and I could see the kitchen was so dirty. Every time I walked by the kitchen I smell so stinky like sewage that's why I didn't take my free breakfast. This hotel doesn't have proper parking area. I really don't recommend to stay in this hotel with executive suite. I felt I got scammed as the picture and the real hotel situation is by far different. I feel really disappointed.",2024-01-23,7

1743116909-31,FA,9.4,"Good stay. First of all, it's clean. The taps' metals are all shiny, meaning they're adequately scrubbed. The sheets are clean. The room floor shiny.üëç. I don't know for sure but I'm guessing this was a more luxurious hotel in the past. The amenities are better than its price range. It has a work desk. It has an outdoor bath tub which is novel. It has a couch. Good stuffs üëç. Some reviews did mention it's not clean enough, but I disagree. At least judging by my experience. Those reviews are not entirely wrong, but it does miss a point. As I said, this was probably a more luxurious hotel in the past, which is why I can understand that those luxury parts are not well maintained. That outdoor bathtub, the floor is wooden so it broke in some places. It's fine. They're places where you won't access anyway if you're a normal joe. But make sure you close the door properly, otherwise mosquitos can come in. To be fair to the hotel guys, they did put a huge warning, though not easily understood. So that's it. Just don't open the outdoor bath tub and you'll be fine. I never used the bathtub because the shower and toilet are more than enough. When you do use the bathtub, close the glass door immediately. One of the best things about this hotel is its location. Just cross the road and it's Bali Galeria Mall. Very close to Kuta, you can walk if you want to (though most people won't, but I did). Local tourists can also take solace that there's a Kapau restaurant nearby.",2023-10-22,6

I hope that the owner/manager will always check the cleanliness. Not sure if I'm the only one who noticed that most 3-4 Star hotels in Bali really got a dirty toilet.

1743116909-257,Angeline,9.4,"I chose this hotel because I stayed here in during a vacation in 2016 and I loved the room so much. I loved the interior, concept, amenities, basically everything. It complies with my expectations of a boutique hotel. But this other time I stayed there, it wasn‚Äôt as pleasurable as the first time. Firstly, the room looked different than the one I stayed in before. I did mention during check-in that I‚Äôve stayed at the property before and had this type of room on this floor. But the receptionist said that the rooms on that floor weren‚Äôt ready, and upgraded my room to Junior Suite. Not sure if it was, but it clearly didn‚Äôt meet my expectations of a Junior Suite. The aircon is placed above the room door, making the room warm since the air circulation gets blocked by the position of the bathroom which is just beside the entrance. Also the bathroom was not as I initially expected. My first room got a nice large bathtub located indoor while this one had the same bathtub, but it was outdoor in the balcony (there‚Äôs a sliding glass door separating the balcony with the bathroom area). Previous room also had separated shower and toilet, while this one had it placed in the same cubicle. I had a balcony with this room, but it still couldn‚Äôt make up my disappointment on the room in general. Now put the bad things aside, and let‚Äôs talk about the plus of this hotel. Their service is definitely something I can recommend people of. They‚Äôre all friendly, helpful, and welcoming. I had my breakfast at almost 10am and despite having everything ready to be cleaned up, they still welcomed me and even helped me with my coffee and everything. Most hotel staffs would be rude to guests who come for breakfast when it‚Äôs almost time to clean up, but they weren‚Äôt. The rooftop pool is nice and big enough for me, and they also have a bar there. The location is convenient and close to the airport, although you might need to drive for around 10 mins by bike to reach Kuta Beach, 15 to Seminyak, and so on. Obviously not walkable, so you need a transport to go around. All in all I‚Äôd still book this hotel next time I visit Bali, because apart from my complaints I had an enjoyable stay in this property.

The room is lack of lighting (though its their concept they said), but it's inviting a lot of mosquito around the room. Must ask for the mosquito killer spray (a bit helps but not really). Should avoid room with balcony as this room is having open space on the bathroom side which where the mosquito will sneak to your room (indeed they have a glass door as divider, but seems not helping that much). No towel available at the pool (they asked us to use the room towel first and then request for the new one at room, but then at the room they said we are supposedly just get it at the pool as each room just will be provided with 2 towel). Good breakfast anyway.

A big shopping mall is in walking distance, so it is very convenience for you if you need to buy something or want something to eat. The service is ok and the staff is polite, friendly and helpful. At morning the breakfast is complete and has all the standard food you need to start your day.

1743116909-668,W***a,6.3,"Only for a cheap price can you get a very beautiful room, especially the bathroom with bathtub. The bathroom is beautiful with lots of mirrors and spacious. The mattress is clean and tidy. The rooms are spacious. TV with lots of channels and clear. Maybe because they got a cheap price, rooms like OO rooms were forced to be sold. There is a lot of damage to the interior which is dangerous and ruins the aesthetics. There are many dirty spots in the interior such as curtains, bathroom chairs, sinks and bathroom walls. There was dirt and other people's hair in the bathroom. Bathmats are not provided, while the shower room and toilet are in the same place. The bathtub is located outdoors with a view of the highway and river. My room is on the top floor, while the curtain covering the bathtub area is transparent from below (the main road and the residence/stall), so you need to be careful when bathing. This bathtub curtain cover also moves easily when blown by the wind and hits the surrounding wood/iron parts, which causes a noisy clinking sound. Even though the room is on the high floor, the noise from the main road is still very audible, plus the surrounding roads are often jammed because vehicles have to cross the bridge over the river, the sound of the horn is very annoying and the balcony doors/windows around are not soundproof. Wifi is often down and slow. The AC is near the entrance, which is far from the bedroom center, so it needs to be set very cold and the fan very loud. Requested housekeeping service on the second night, no one came. This means there is no housekeeping service and no refill of amenities. In my opinion, this is not comparable to what is marketed as a 4 star hotel. On the other hand, the staff is friendly. Especially the front desk agent who was very friendly and helpful. Tips for those who want to stay here, it's better to show the room first, and decide whether the room is comfortable and suitable or not.",2024-06-30,4

There should have been 2 flush buttons but there was only 1. The sink had a big spider. The bathtub is in its own room (outdoor) when it is opened the room smells of cat litter. The bathtub itself is dirty too. The floor of the room was also not cleaned, my son's feet were thick black when walking around the room. I booked a family suite which in the photo of the room is very spacious. But when we got there the bed and bathroom door were only 30cm (just enough for people to pass by).

As for the room, the first time I entered the room there was a musty smell like a room made of wood which had not been used for a long time, so I even bought a air freshener to remove the smell, all amenities were ok, there were no slippers, I had requested but until the last day was not given. And for some amenities such as toothbrushes are only given 1 (even though I'm both with my husband) and sometimes have to be asked, many sinks are chipped and not maintained (very unsightly to the eye), hair drayer on the last day suddenly died, food waste overnight was not thrown when asked clean rooms, bed sheets etc. must be discussed first to be replaced then replaced, bed covers have holes and stains, telephone sometimes error and difficult to use, to call the receptionist must be repeated many times. Towels on the last day must be requested and then given. The room is not soundproof, the sound of people stepping is very audible, especially the sound from the upper floor, some staff are not friendly when they meet us, the main lobby tends to be hot because the air conditioner is less pronounced, it seems like a lot needs to be repaired and refurbished, when there is no first entry greeting from the receptionist or from the security in front, the parking lot is very narrow. Honestly for the standard of a 4 star hotel it is far from expectations, and it seems like I will not return to stay there again. A plus for the roptop swimming pool, according to the photos provided the rooms are cleaned every day. Especially for the fairly cold mineral water, for the refrigerator can still be used even if it is not so cold, the bathub is ok according to the photo. Suggestions for those who are going to stay here should be checked into all rooms first, starting from amenities, telephone, toilet, etc., so that if we are uncomfortable, we can find another room (if there are still empty ones), at least Mas the receptionist guard is still kind enough to sweep us to another room if you want to change rooms, and it's better to choose a deluxe.

At 10 am the room was knocked asking whether the room would be cleaned or not, very unethical. Many room conditions need repairs, whether or not housekeeping controls exist? Cleanliness is also very far from hotel standards, cobwebs in rooms, granite baths are dull. The pool was dark at night, so guests discouraged from using the pool at night. Welcome drink that should be given at check in (just name &quot;welcome drink&quot;), but must be exchanged at the pool bar on the top floor. I had breakfast around 9:30 a.m., the menu was almost gone, the remaining juice and bread were perfunctory, parking was also very limited. I have difficulty finding space to park if I return at midnight. I plan to stay for 9 nights (2kmr) and I have paid for the first 5 nights (the first night I canceled, but it can&#39;t because I paid for 5 days) and I decided to move to another hotel for the next 4 nights. At check out, the FO staff also objected if only 30 minutes late check out (I brought 1 baby and 1 child 6 years old). Management needs to control the quality of service (especially housekeeping and front office) and instill the spirit of hospitality to all of its staff.

Provide umbrella at least. In fact the driver of the taxi online fast response off the suitcase from the car. Pas want to check in any the front office is also less welcome, fitting come also no welcome, and asked the room was no single room available, strangely, no one cook ready. Because he said the policy here was checked in start at 14.00. Finally I decided to go to the mall first, the security also helped cross me and my wife&#39;s son is only halfway, then the road next to it I was left to cross itself, so when I return from the Mall, even the security cuek pretend not to know. When I want to check in again, with different Staff, this is the first time the hotel that underestimates this check before looking at or requesting the booking voucher code, with the reason to confirm that the data is appropriate, is not it enough to call the name of the buyer and borrow ID Card, and again the condition of the room is quite nice concept and design, but unfortunately the room is very narrow, plus air circulation is very minimal because of the lack of air circulation so make the room more so stuffy and make not stay at home long.

Only yesterday because we went every morning at 5 (to hunt for sunrise), we could ask the hotel to prepare a breakfast box whose menu could be chosen between fried rice / Indonesian noodles (Indonesian food) or sandwiches (American food). Room: clean and comfortable. I used 2 executive suite rooms yesterday. The room is spacious according to the picture and description. In the room you can choose to take a shower or bath in a bathtub complete with hot water. Oiya in front of the bathtub there is a tv, so we can watch while soaking. * tips: choose a room that has a balcony (because it is limited) pool: on the rooftop. There is a cafe too. Suitable for relaxing sunrise or sunset. View of the river and the city. Parking lot: the car park area in this hotel is indeed minimal. Only limited in the hotel lobby. But just calm, hotel security is ready to secure the car park. We just need to key. And certainly: safe. Overall: this hotel is very safe and comfortable to live in. Especially for family occasions.
